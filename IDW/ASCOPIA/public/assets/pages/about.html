                    This website is populated by a RESTful API called PokéApi, this API covers specifically the video game franchise, providing information on pokémons, movesets, abilities, types, eggs and more.
                    It follows a basic structure of showing a specific pokemon and its stats.

                                Firstly we have the pokémon sprite, which can be found into in-game pokédex from real pokémon games, followed by the pokemon's name and type(s)
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                After that we have the pokemon's stats, showing its in-game health, attack and defense points
                            </p>
